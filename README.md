## RDKit IPython Tools
by Axel Pahl

The toolkit currently contains two functions to use with [RDKit](http://rdkit.org) in the IPython notebook:  
- *show_table*: Display a list of molecules in a table with molecule properties as columns.  
When an ID property is given, the table becomes interactive and compounds can be selected.

- *jsme*: Display Peter Ertl's Javascript Molecule Editor to enter a molecule directly in the IPython notebook (*how cool is that??*)


A demonstration is worth a thousand words, so please have a look at the example notebook [rdkit_ipynb_tools.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/apahl/rdkit_ipynb_tools/blob/master/rdkit_ipynb_tools_1.ipynb).

The toolkit was written with and for Python3, but should also work on Python2. If not, please let me know.
